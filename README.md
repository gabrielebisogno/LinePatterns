# LinePatterns

This is my Project for the course of "Program Languages" at the "University of Milano-Bicocca".
The purpose is to find all the possible lines from a random number of points with a random value.
We have also some fuction of Input/Output to read the points from a file.
You can find all the explanations of how the code works in the directiories of Prolog and Lisp.

Bye!
